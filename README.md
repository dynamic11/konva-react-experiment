# üè∑Ô∏è konva-react Image Annotation Tool

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è This project is a work in progress created using CodeSandbox, intended as a proof of concept.

The purpose of this project was to demonstrate the feasibility of implementing an image annotation tool using the HTML Canvas. We utilized the konva-react library to interact with the Canvas and incorporated components from MUI for the user interface.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Tech used:
- react
- konva-react
- MUI

## ‚ú® Key Features:
- [x] Draw rectangles to highlight areas of the image
- [x] Enable/desable drawing using toggle
- [x] Cancel area selection using `esc` key
- [x] Show popover when an area is highlighted
- [ ] Toggle between tool types (incomplete)

## üêû Known bugs/feature requests
- Tool selection does not work (only the `Area` option works)
- The popover for the area in the canvas doesn't align because its `absolute` position in `CSS` is being miscalculated
- Image/canvas don't resize correctly (responsiveness)
- Hide or highlight areas on the canvas using the table
- Group shapes in the table by type
